# Setup testing

So, linting is set up.

The next step is setting up the testing framework.

The most common test frameworks used with React are [https://jestjs.io](Jest)
and [https://mochajs.org/](Mocha).

There are pros and cons on both framework.

[https://blog.usejournal.com/jest-vs-mocha-whats-the-difference-235df75ffdf3](This)
is a fast and fairly balanced comparison on the two, with the bonus of
mentioning [https://airbnb.io/enzyme/](Enzyme).

Since we have a small, new and fairly tidy project, we'll start with Jest, which
has the added bonus of requiring less configuration and having no need for
external assertion libraries.
